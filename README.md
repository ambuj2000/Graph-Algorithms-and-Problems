So my point was that dfs is much more useful.
Bfs has limitations in sense that everytime you cannot apply it 
But dfs has randomness due to which you can use it at most of the places.
It also helps you to improve dp/ recursion type of concepts.
What i will recommend is that solve some problems and in all cases try to give priority to dfs you will understand its beauty!!
